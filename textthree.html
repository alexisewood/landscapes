   Air was caught in my throat, the bubbles piercing my chest trying to escape. I can’t breathe. <br> <br> 
     The sound was like a freight train ripping by and I couldn’t even hear my own panic anymore. <br> <br>   Flood water was gushing into the house from under all the doors; it was becoming clear that bath towels would not hold back the carnage outside.<br> <br>  
     I started my retreat upstairs. We were in the middle of an evacuation zone. We had been for 24 hours, but as my mother said, “Real Floridans don’t leave during a hurricane.” <br> <br>   
     I drained the emergency drinking water from the bathtub and we both climbed inside, pulling my bedroom mattress overhead to brace ourselves against whatever debris might fall on top of us. <br> <br>  
     Soaking wet, we stared at each other in silence for the next two hours, waiting to see if we would survive as a hurricane consumed our home. <br> <br>  
     Even after that, years after that, we never did leave, and she never regretted it. <br> <br>  
     A few days later, when the ocean still occupied the land and the neighbors remained absent, I floated down 85th street on an inflatable pool raft to catch lobsters. 
 <br> <br> <br> ... <br> <br> <br>  

In that particular moment, in that particular dimension, space is composed of the confluence and non-confluence of flows.<br> <br>
     Different viscosities of aether moving us as we navigate through the world and locate ourselves within it. <br> <br>
     As we move - as we caress the aether - we too characterize and create it. <br> <br>
     What memories and hauntings are left in our paths? What and whose residues are we navigating through?
