   <p> “Space is not a collection of pre-existing points set out in a fixed geometry, a container, as it were, for matter to inhabit. Matter isn’t situated in the world; matter is worlding in its materiality.” 
(Barad, 2007: 180-181) <br> <br> <br>
   I spent one evening this summer speaking to a Computer Science lecturer visiting from a university in Ireland. <br> 
      We found each other in the sea of tech workers at a party in San Francisco and decided to pair off for the evening with a bottle of wine.<br>
      As the afternoon faded, fog began to roll across the bay. She was absolutely mesmerized by it and we spent our time staring into the clouds as they overtook the water. <br> 
      She broke the silence, “There’s no other place like this.” I asked her what she meant. <br> 
      “The way the landscape changes with the day and the night … it’s like the earth is breathing…one big inhale in the mid-morning, and one big exhale at night.” <br>
      I leaned back in my chair, “Well, it’s not as poetic as fog over the Bay, but I guess Florida's version would be a cloud of mosquitoes which descends in the evening and dissipates in the morning.” <br>
      She didn’t laugh, but seriously pondered on the thought. <br>
      We sat in silence as the landscape enveloped us. </p>
