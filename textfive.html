   I think it’s right that each age can be understood as having its own “structure of feeling” (Williams 1979: 223), a narrative structure for understanding material limits to change, or how one settled and conditioned within these particular structures will necessarily be influenced by them (Gilmore, 2017: 237).<br> <br>  
      In this configuration, these structures are not like ideology. They are not distinct or immediately available. <br> <br> 
      They are murky and to some degree ineffable. <br> <br> 
     Stories are not an active confluence, there is a gap between my description, the experience, and what is being experienced; structures of feeling are dynamic, continuous, and never finished. <br> <br> 
      Somewhat unhelpful, an unreasonable tension between the experienced and articulable, but there are two things here: while process is not articulable, feeling is identifiable; and feelings, sometimes the most unreasonable aspects of the human experience, have a dynamically substantive shape. <br> <br> 
      Feelings are embedded into the landscape. <br> <br> 
      They shape space. They shape experience, and possibly even more important, limit conceptions of possibility.<br> <br> 
      People will work their way through the world, being met with these ebbs and flows through time, deeply textured by those who came before them, and erode their own paths. <br> <br> 
      The landscape projects onto them, and they project onto the landscape. <br> <br> 
      This accumulation produces a narrative arc towards something, and this arc, in this moment in time, has produced a crystallization of process in the form of a radical action. <br> <br> 
      This is not a true representation of process, this is fundamentally impossible, but it is insight into what is occurring, what happens in this gap between experience and description and what is to come.    <br> <br> <br> ... <br> <br> <br>
