   In August of 2018, the Carr fire was ripping through Shasta County. <br> <br>
   In the past month, Shasta Lake had taken on the characteristics of what I imagined Armageddon to look like as a child in my Floridian Baptist school - the sky, a deep fiery red and the air, thick with soot. <br> <br> 
   The fire, combined with severe asthma, restricted me for weeks, but it was finally time to go. <br> <br> 
   My first year at UC Berkeley was about to begin, an escape I had been dreaming about for three years now, but I was heavy with guilt.<br> <br>
   Packing up the back of the Ford Ranger in a dirty mist of ash, my things slowly collected a layer of black grit and I wondered if the house knew I was abandoning it, if the lake knew, if my neighbors knew. <br> <br>
   I was running away.<br> <br>
   The Carr fire had jumped the Sacramento River, something which I was assured would never happen. <br> <br>The silence that overtook the neighborhood when we found out was deafening. <br> <br>
   That moment was the eye of the hurricane, a moment to take stock and reassess what we thought we knew, and in this, what we clearly did not know. <br> <br> 
   After triple checking the bungee cords stretched across the bed of the truck as a form of procrastination, I stepped into the car. <br> <br>
   Hoarsely coughing and struggling to catch my breath, I placed my head on the steering wheel. <br> <br>
   Would I ever return to Shasta Lake? Would it still be here if I returned? A burnt out husk or nothing at all? <br> <br> <br> ... <br> <br> <br>  

As summers become dryer, as rains become heavier, as storms become more intense, the havoc on the physical landscape becomes more unbearable. <br> <br> 
The fires which rip through Northern Californiaâ€™s deciduous forest and the flood waters which drown the land of Hurricane Alley are intensely reshaping the physicality of these places. <br> <br> 
Yes, but they are also fundamentally changing an emotional landscape which drapes, cuts, and curls through the geomorphology. <br> <br> 
What waits for us when we navigate that aether? <br> <br>
One scarred by the ghosts of places and people that no longer exist, the hauntings of possibilities and opportunities which have been stolen by something completely avoidable? <br> <br>
These particular scars on imaginings of the future pose not just something deeply poignant, but in many configurations, something incredibly dangerous.   <br> <br> <br> ... <br> <br> <br> </p>
